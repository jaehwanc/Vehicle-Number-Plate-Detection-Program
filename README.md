# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-Program

It compares the numerical image of the car license plate with the correlation value of each comparative image 
and recognizes the 4 digit number of the license plate image.

If the data size of the compared license plate is too large, the size of the image is limited to 100KB because 
the correlation dalay time becomes too long.
